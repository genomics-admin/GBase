Points:-
1.	Need Unix environment - FTP support for the file storage for faster and more efficient file handling.
2.	Need to build filename base distribution, monitoring and execution system instead of additional scheduler.txt based system to avoid unexpected deadlocks.
3.	Need dedicated machines for execution. (Srinivas will consult with Sanjay on this point)
4.	Initial data fetch logic to and from FTP need to be built.
5.	Sending email at the end of Execution logic need to be build.
6.	Abrupt termination handling logic need to be built for main file split and sub file processing code.
7.	Need to maintain central working folder for all the sub files.
8.	All the search keys (ATG,TATA..etc) need to be considered while splitting the file to avoid boundary region related issues.
9.	Output file should be in a format of key-value/csv.
10.	We might need to either implement a parser for the output file if we are providing a file with a format only known to us or provide the output in a generic format.
